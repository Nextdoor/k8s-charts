This chart provides a default deployment for a simple application that operates
in a [Deployment][deployments]. The chart automatically configures various
defaults for you like the Kubernetes [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler][hpa].

## Upgrade Notes

### 0.2.x -> 1.0.x

**BREAKING: All PrometheusRules are now scoped to `.Release.Name` resources by default**

All of the `PrometheusRules` within this chart are now scoped to try to
narrowly match resources that have the {{`{{ .Release.Name }}`}} prefix. This means
that rather than looking at _all_ `Deployment` resources in a Namespace, we're
now only looking at {{`deployment=~{{ .Release.Name }}`}} by default now.

The motivation for this change is to allow the `prometheus-rules` chart to be
applied to each individual `Application` within a Namespace, without
conflicting.

This behavior can be tuned via the `defaults.podNameSelector`,
`defaults.jobNameSelector`, `defaults.deploymentNameSelector`,
`defaults.statefulsetNameSelector`, `defaults.daemonsetNameSelector` and
`defaults.hpaNameSelector` values below.
